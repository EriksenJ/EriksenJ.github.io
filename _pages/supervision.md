# Supervision guide


I supervise Bachelor projects and Master theses. My research interests are in education and labor economics and applied microeconometrics. This is also where I am strongest as a supervisor.

Want to ask if I can supervise your project? Send me an email with your idea(s) for the project topic. If I think I can supervise your project, we'll set up a meeting.

Before starting your project, I strongly recommend you to go through the resources below:

- Anders Munk-Nielsen's supervision [page](https://andersmunkn.netlify.app/teaching/supervision/)
- Jacob SÃ¸gaard's supervision [guide](https://www.jakobsogaard.com/start/teaching)

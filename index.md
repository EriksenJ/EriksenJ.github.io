I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ku.dk/), University of Copenhagen, and a member of [EduQuant](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/externally-funded-research_new/uddankvant/).  My research focuses on what drives education choice, social mobility, and labor market matching.  Some of my ongoing projects study the socio-economic differences in returns to field of study, multigenerational effects of educational reforms, and firm-student matching in apprenticeship markets. 

I have previously advised the Danish Ministry of Education as a member of EduQuant, been an invited presenter as a national expert on vocational education at the OECD/Cedefop, and worked as a short-term consultant for the World Bank. During my PhD and Postdoc I was a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Department of Social Policy at the LSE, UMass Amherst, and CEBI at the University of Copenhagen.

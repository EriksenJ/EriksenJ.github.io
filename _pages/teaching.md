# Supervision guide


I supervise Bachelor projects and Master theses. My research interests are in labor and education economics and applied microeconometrics. This is also where I am strongest as a supervisor.

Want to ask if I can supervise your project? Send me an email with your idea(s) for the project topic. If I think I can supervise your project, we'll set up a meeting.

Resources I strongly recommend you to go through before starting your project:

- Anders Munk-Nielsen's supervision page: [link](https://andersmunkn.netlify.app/teaching/supervision/)
- Jacob Søgaard's supervision guide: [link](https://www.jakobsogaard.com/start/teaching)

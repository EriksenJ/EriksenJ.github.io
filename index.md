![*Jesper Eriksen*](avatar_round-modified.png){:style="float:right; margin:10px; width: 20%;"}

I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ku.dk/), University of Copenhagen, and a member of [EduQuant](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/externally-funded-research_new/uddankvant/).  My research focuses on education choice, social mobility, and labor market matching. Some of my ongoing projects study the socio-economic differences in returns to field of study, multigenerational effects of educational reforms, and firm-student matching in apprenticeship markets. 

I have advised the Danish Ministry of Education as a member of EduQuant, been an invited presenter at the OECD/Cedefop as a national expert on vocational education, and worked as a short-term consultant for the World Bank. During my PhD and Postdoc I was a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Department of Social Policy at the LSE, UMass Amherst, and CEBI at the University of Copenhagen.

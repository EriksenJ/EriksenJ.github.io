![Jesper Eriksen](avatar.jpg){:style="float:left; margin:10px; width: 30%;"}

I am a Postdoc at [EduQuant](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/externally-funded-research_new/uddankvant/) and the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen.  My research investigates drivers of educational inequalities and intergenerational mobility. Some ongoing projects study the socio-economic differences in returns to education, multigenerational effects of educational reforms, firm-student matching in apprenticeship markets, and peer effects in classrooms. 

As a member of EduQuant I have advised the Danish Ministry of Education. Previously, I have held an invited presentation at the OECD/Cedefop as a Danish national expert on vocational education and worked as a short term consultant for the World Bank. I have also been a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Department of Social Policy at the LSE, and CEBI at the University of Copenhagen.

I am a Postdoc at [EduQuant](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/externally-funded-research_new/uddankvant/) and the [Department of Sociology](https://www.sociology.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen.  My research investigates social mobility, and drivers of education choices and market outcomes. Some ongoing projects study the socio-economic differences in returns to education, multigenerational effects of educational reforms, and firm-student matching in apprenticeship markets. 

As a member of EduQuant I have advised the Danish Ministry of Education. I have presented my research at the OECD/Cedefop as an invited national expert on vocational education, and worked as a short term consultant for the World Bank. During my PhD and postdoc I was a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Department of Social Policy at the LSE, UMass Amherst, and CEBI at the University of Copenhagen.

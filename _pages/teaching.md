# Supervision guide


I supervise both Bachelor projects and Master theses. My main research interests are in labor and education economics, where I focus applied microeconometric work. This is also where I am strongest as a supervisor.

If you consider asking me to be your supervisor, send me an email with your idea for the project topic. If I think I can supervise your project, we'll set up a meeting. 

Resources I strongly recommend you to go through before starting your project:

- Anders Munk-Nielsen's supervision page: [link](https://andersmunkn.netlify.app/teaching/supervision/)
- Jacob Søgaard's supervision guide: [link](https://www.jakobsogaard.com/start/teaching)
